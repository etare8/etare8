# Ciao :)

Hi, my name is Mattia!

I am a Nuclear Engineer and I will upload here some codes, exercises and simple projects that I carry out for fun!

I am trying to learn Python for nuclear applications, therefore some codes are exercises in the use of the OpenMC library for neutronics.
Since I am also interested in learning Artificial Intelligence principles using Python, I will upload also some codes concerning AI an Machine Learning.

This repository is simply a pesonal repository and I do not pretend to be a good developer at all ahahah
