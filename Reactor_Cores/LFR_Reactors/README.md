# Modelling a Reactor Core similar to LFR Reactor Design

The Generation IV International Forum (GIF) selected different types of Reactor Designs for the new GenIV of Nuclear Reactors. Among the six reactor technologies there is the Lead-cooled Fast Reactor technology.

The goals of the projects aiming at designing reactors of this kind are:

* demonstrate the feasibility of the LFR technology
* demonstrate the capability to comply with GenIV goals of sustainability and MAs burning capability

Different Reactors designs are under development, such as the *European Lead Fast Reactor* (ELFR) with the ELSY project, the *ALFRED* SMR Reactor, *SSTAR*, and so on.
