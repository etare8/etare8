# Modelling a Reactor Core similar to LFR Reactor Design

The Generation IV International Forum (GIF) selected different types of Reactor Designs for the new GenIV of Nuclear Reactors. Among the six reactor technologies there is the Lead-cooled Fast Reactor technology.

The goals of the projects aiming at designing reactors of this kind are:

* demonstrate the feasibility of the LFR technology
* demonstrate the capability to comply with GenIV goals of sustainability and MAs burning capability

Different Reactors designs are reference systems for the GIF LFR activities, namely the *European Lead Fast Reactor* (ELFR) with the ELSY project (large-size), the American *SSTAR* (small-size), and the Russian *BREST* (mid-size).

R&D activities are carried out by countries/entities to develop new design of Lead-cooled Fast Reactors. In Europe (Euratom) there are two main projects under development for the Lead/Lead-Bismuth technology: the *MYRRHA* Reactor and the *ALFRED* reactor.
